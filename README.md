# **Credit Card Fraud Detection**
[Credit card fraud dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) is perfect example of imbalanced skewed dataset with great amount of records.
in this project I tried to use some technics like precision, recall and F1-score to analize the accuracy of constructed model.

**Note**: [Report file](https://github.com/FarzamTP/Credit-Cart-Fraud-Detection/blob/master/FraudDetectionReport.pdf) is prepared for further information.
